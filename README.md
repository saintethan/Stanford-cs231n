# cs231n @ Stanford University

## About me

I am not a registered student at Stanford University. Due to the requirement of one of my current projects (from [ITN-CONTRA](https://itn-contra.org/)), I need to learn Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) almost from the scratch. Of course, basics of calculus, linear algebra, and object oriented programming languages, like C++, Python or Java, are necessary.

## About this repository

Standford's [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is literally the most approriate material to get inside into deep learning and machine vision, at least from my viewpoint. This repository contains all of the three assignments of the course, in which all the blanks are or will be filled by myself. 

## How to use this repository?

1. Be stuck when implementing your assignment (which I believe is the most case)? 

Click the specific file in this repository and check the corresponding code. I have successfully tested all of the code published here; however, in order to be safe, I will not say that my implementation is totally correct. Therefore, if you have any problems, please feel free to raise an issue or send me an Email.

2. Only want to test this implementation?

Just `clone` it - you know, the normal procedure.

## Learning suggestion

1. For assignment 1, study lecture 1 to lecture 6.

## What is the current progress?

Till 10/03/2019, the implementation of [assignment 1](https://github.com/saintethan/Stanford-cs231n/tree/master/assignment1) has been completed.

I will complete the rest of the two assignments ASAP.

## TODO

1. A guide on setting the environment.

2. Assignment 2.

3. Assignment 3.
